<b>In this project I've made use of the Airbnb dataset. I use Tableau to draw meaningful insights from the dataset.</b><br>
<br>
The few insights that I have made are: Room Type Frequency, Listing frequency, Hosting frequency, Comparative analysis between neighbourhood groups,
Host acquisition rate,Max price and Percentage of total listings.<br>
<br>
All the worksheets have been summarized with the help of a story titled 'House Rentals in NYC'.
